        <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
            <p>I am a Front-End Web Developer based out of Nashville specializing in html, CSS, and Javascript and JQuery. In my free time I enjoy writing fanfiction, endless fiddling with existing art and code projects, and hanging out on the apartment balcony with my three cats.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite feelings is that ‘Ah-hah’ moment, when you find a misplaced piece to the puzzle you were working on and it was so freaking simple that you want to scream and throw something but before you do, you notice the brand-new and interesting problems that arose from your solution and you’re enthralled in the project again, ignoring the aching of your shoulders, the itching of your eyes, the growl of your stomach, as the real world fades away into your zone, leaving only your fingers, keyboard, and monitor.  Just me?</p>
            <p>I also enjoy run-on sentences and, superfluous commas. </p>

                <p class="quizDescrip">The Brief Biology Quiz asks five high-school biology questions in the format of a scored single multiple-choice question and, on submission, the correct answer and possible added point. At the appearance of the answer, the user is prompted to click for the next question and this format continues until the results page. Upon completion, the site shows the user’s total score, the number of questions, and offers a button to retry the quiz from the beginning. </p>
