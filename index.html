                <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a Front-End Web Developer based out of Nashville specializing in html, CSS, and Javascript and
                    JQuery. In my free time I enjoy writing fanfiction, endless fiddling with existing art and code
                    projects, and hanging out on the apartment balcony with my three cats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite feelings is that ‘Ah-hah’ moment, when you find a misplaced piece to the puzzle
                    you
                    were working on and it was so freaking simple that you want to scream and throw something but before
                    you
                    do, you notice the brand-new and interesting problems that arose from your solution and you’re
                    enthralled in the project again, ignoring the aching of your shoulders, the itching of your eyes,
                    the
                    growl of your stomach, as the real world fades away into your zone, leaving only your fingers,
                    keyboard,
                    and monitor. Just me
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy run-on sentences and, superfluous commas.

                    The Brief Biology Quiz asks five high-school biology questions in the format of a scored single
                    multiple-choice question and, on submission, the correct answer and possible added point. At the
                    appearance of the answer, the user is prompted to click for the next question and this format
                    continues until the results page. Upon completion, the site shows the user’s total score, the number
                    of questions, and offers a button to retry the quiz from the beginning.
