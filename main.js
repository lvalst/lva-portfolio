The very second you find that single
    misplaced piece of the puzzle
        and it was so freaking simple,
            and you want to—<em>need</em> to—, 
                scream and throw something—!
But then you find
    your answer spawned interesting, <em>new</em>, problems
        and you’re enthralled again and ignoring 
            the aching of your shoulders,
                    the itching of your eyes,
                        the growl of your stomach.
    The rest of the world fades to nothing,
        leaving only your
            monitor,
                keyboard,
                    fingers...
        ...just me?</code></pre>
